## FAQ

### What is Dongtober?

If you found this mod and you don't know what Dongtober is, I'm sorry. Dongtober is an annual celebration in the month of October among the [Barry](https://twitch.tv/barry) community where we make Donkey Kong art and memes.

### Isn't Jonkey Kong too powerful to be a Common Joker?

Yeah, if I was actually trying to balance this, I'd probably put Jonkey Kong at Uncommon. But if you're installing this mod, you probably want Jonkey Kong to appear in your shops and boosters as often as possible. If I felt like putting in more effort maybe I'd make his rarity a config option. It'd be really funny to get him from a Soul card.

### I'm trying to install the required mods and my antivirus is freaking out?

Steamodded requires Lovely, which is literally a code injector for the engine Balatro is built on. That means everything will flag it as malware. Steamodded includes instructions on how to get around this in their installation guide.

### I want to experience playing with Jonkey Kong but he hasn't shown up in my shop yet?

Yeah I quickly had this problem when trying to test my mod code. I recommend this mod by infarctus to [guarantee the joker that appears in your first shop.](https://www.nexusmods.com/balatro/mods/11/) Instead of going to your collection to choose the joker, go to the mods tab, select this mod, go to additions, and open the Jokers. You can select the joker with the mod even if you haven't seen it in game yet.

### Jonkey Kong caused a bug in my game?

Nice! Reach out to me on discord and tell me about it, especially if it's funny. I might even try to fix it after. I'm in the Balatro discord and the Barry discord, so if you found this, you can probably find me.
